# Unified Media Converter - Python Requirements

# Core Requirements (Essential)
# These are required for basic functionality
tkinter  # Usually included with Python installations
shutil   # Standard library
subprocess  # Standard library
json     # Standard library
threading  # Standard library
queue    # Standard library
wave     # Standard library
pathlib  # Standard library
dataclasses  # Standard library

# Essential External Dependencies
# These must be installed separately
ffmpeg-python>=0.2.0  # For media processing (requires system-wide FFmpeg installation)
# Note: FFmpeg must be installed separately and accessible in system PATH

# Optional Dependencies (Recommended for Full Functionality)
# These enhance functionality but aren't strictly required
numpy>=1.21.0        # For DSP calculations and FIR filter design
matplotlib>=3.4.0    # For frequency response visualization
simpleaudio>=1.0.0    # For audio preview/playback
tkinterdnd2>=0.3.0    # For drag-and-drop functionality

# Development/Build Dependencies
# Required for creating executables and installers
pyinstaller>=5.0.0    # For creating standalone executables
cx_Freeze>=6.10.0     # Alternative executable creation tool

# Installation Instructions:
# 1. Install FFmpeg separately (system-wide installation):
#    - Windows: choco install ffmpeg OR download from https://ffmpeg.org/download.html
#    - macOS: brew install ffmpeg
#    - Linux: sudo apt install ffmpeg (Ubuntu/Debian)
#
# 2. Install Python dependencies:
#    pip install -r requirements.txt
#
# 3. For minimal installation (core functionality only):
#    pip install ffmpeg-python
#
# 4. For full functionality:
#    pip install numpy matplotlib simpleaudio tkinterdnd2
#
# 5. For executable creation:
#    pip install pyinstaller cx_Freeze
